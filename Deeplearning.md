## 🧠 **Deep Learning Mastery Roadmap — Ashish Style**

---

### 🚩 **Phase 1: Foundations of Deep Learning**

#### 1. What is Deep Learning?

**🔍 Why it exists:** Traditional ML struggles with unstructured data (images, audio, text). DL automates feature extraction and excels in high-dimensional, complex tasks.
**🧠 Analogy:** Think of ML as a chef using a recipe (hand-coded rules), and DL as a chef who invents recipes by tasting (learning features).
**💻 Practice:**

* Install TensorFlow and PyTorch
* Build a single-layer neural network
  **✅ Checkpoint:**
* What makes DL different from ML?
* What kinds of problems benefit from DL?

* [Intro to Deep Learning – MIT](https://introtodeeplearning.mit.edu/)

---

### 🔹 **Phase 2: Neural Networks (The Core)**

#### 2. Perceptron & Multi-layer Neural Networks

**🔍 Why:** They're the building blocks. Every deep model is a chain of neurons.
**🧠 Analogy:** Like circuits in electronics – input → processing → output
**💻 Code:**

* Build MLP from scratch using PyTorch
* Predict handwritten digits (MNIST)

**✅ Checkpoint:**

* Understand forward pass and basic matrix math
* Build a 3-layer NN
* Practice XOR problem

* [PyTorch Official Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)

---

### 🔥 **Phase 3: Activation & Loss Functions**

#### 3. Activation Functions

**🔍 Why:** Add non-linearity so neural networks can learn complex patterns
**🧠 Analogy:** Like decision-making in humans — binary decisions vs fuzzy reasoning
**Key Functions:** Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, Leaky ReLU
**💻 Code:** Plot activations, use them in layers
**✅ Quiz:**

* When to use ReLU vs Sigmoid?
* What happens if no activation is used?

#### 4. Loss Functions

**🔍 Why:** Measure how far your prediction is from reality
**🧠 Analogy:** Like the difference between your exam answer and the correct one
**Key Losses:** MSE, CrossEntropy, Hinge
**💻 Practice:**

* Compare MSE vs CrossEntropy
* Implement custom loss in PyTorch

📚 **Resources:**

* [CS231n: Activation/Loss functions](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

---

### 🔁 **Phase 4: Backpropagation & Optimization**

#### 5. Backpropagation

**🔍 Why:** Tells the network how to learn (calculate gradients & update weights)
**🧠 Analogy:** Like learning from mistakes — revise where you went wrong
**💻 Code:**

* Manually implement backprop on a simple NN
* Visualize gradients
  **✅ Practice Questions:**
* What’s the role of the chain rule?
* How does vanishing gradient occur?

#### 6. Optimization Algorithms

**🔍 Why:** Help find the best model parameters
**🧠 Analogy:** Like different strategies to climb a mountain
**Key Optimizers:** SGD, Adam, RMSProp
**💻 Practice:**

* Compare optimizers on same model
* Use TensorBoard to visualize

### 🧱 **Phase 5: CNNs — Deep Learning for Images**

#### 7. Convolutional Neural Networks

**🔍 Why:** Capture spatial patterns (faces, shapes) in images
**🧠 Analogy:** Like scanning your face row-by-row in a camera sensor
**Layers:** Conv → ReLU → Pooling → FC
**💻 Project:**

* Build CNN for MNIST, CIFAR-10
* Try ResNet using PyTorch

**✅ Checkpoint Quiz:**

* What’s a kernel?
* Why is pooling used?

* [Fast.ai Practical DL for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)

---

### 📈 **Phase 6: Regularization & Tuning**

#### 8. Overfitting & Regularization

**🔍 Why:** DL models overfit easily due to too many parameters
**Key Techniques:** Dropout, L2/L1 Regularization, Data Augmentation
**💻 Practice:**

* Train model with/without dropout
* Apply early stopping
  **✅ Quiz:**
* How does dropout work?
* When to use L2?

---

### ⏳ **Phase 7: RNNs & LSTMs — Deep Learning for Sequences**

#### 9. Recurrent Neural Networks

**🔍 Why:** Handle sequential data (text, time series)
**🧠 Analogy:** Like remembering past words in a sentence
**Problems:** Vanishing gradients → LSTMs
**💻 Code:**

* Character-level text generation
* Sentiment classification on IMDB

#### 10. LSTMs & GRUs

**🔍 Why:** Long-term memory for sequences
**🧠 Analogy:** Like a smart diary that remembers what matters
**💻 Project:**

* Build LSTM text generator
* Train on your own quotes
